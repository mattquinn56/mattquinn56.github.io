<h2>Steam Game Rating Prediction</h2>
<h4>Spring 2022</h4>
<p>A tool for game developers that can predict the rating their game will receive on Steam based on a subset of features of their game. 
    Web scraping was used to obtain the training data, and the subset of features was selected by measuring feature importance on this. 
    This project also utilized SMOTE, sentiment analysis, a GUI, and a collection of machine learning algorithms (of which Random Forest performed best at a 56% precision).</p>

<h2>This Website</h2>
<h4>Summer 2021</h4>
<p>A simple website which I coded from scratch in HTML+CSS to showcase myself and interesting things that I've worked on. I bought the domain at Google Domains and hosted it on GitHub.</p>

<h2>COVID-19 Hospitalizations Prediction for EU Countries</h2>
<h4>Spring 2021</h4>
<p>A prediction of future COVID-19 hospitalizations given a dataset of EU country-level cases by age group and current hospitalizations. The first part of the project predicts whether hospitalizations would increase or decrease a week from each date (with an accuracy of 70%), and the second part predicts how many hospitalizations would occur. Other features include custom training/validation data splitting, preprocessing, and multiple training algorithms. This was my final project for <a href = "https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/CS/4780">Machine Learning</a> that I worked on with another student. The code was written in Python using sklearn, numpy, pandas, and the report was generated in Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<h2>Game of Go</h2>
<h4>Spring 2021</h4>
<p>A fully playable game of Go that features territory calculation, handicap, variable board sizes, and an ELO ranking system. This was my final project for <a href = "https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/CS/3110">Data Structures and Functional Programming</a> that I worked on with three others. The code written in OCaml (mainly using its functional features), and it can be run in Ubuntu using a remote SSH.

<h2>3D Model of the ΦΔΘ NY Alpha Chapter House</h2>
<h4>Spring 2021</h4>
<p>A model done in SketchUp of my fraternity house at Cornell. This was my final project for <a href = "https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/CEE/3080">Intro to CADD</a>.</p>

<h2>Simon Says</h2>
<h4>Spring 2021</h4>
<p>A playable game of Simon Says on a development board. Rather than pressing colored buttons to match the sequence like in the original Simon Says, the board must be tilted in the corresponding directions (this was done using the built-in accelerometer). The code was written in C in MCUXpresso IDE to be uploaded onto a FRDM-KL25Z board. This was my final project for <a href = "https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/CS/3420">Embedded Systems</a> that I worked on with another student.</p>

<h2>Weighted ETF Analysis</h2>
<h4>Winter 2021</h4>
<p>A tool that analyzes the risk (covariance) and reward (expected return) of ETFs. The user is able to plug in any amount of ETFs from what our dataset provides; once selected, a risk vs. reward graph is shown depicting every possible portfolio between the ETFs. From there, the user is able to input a desired risk, and the optimal portfolio at the closest risk is outputted. This project is meant to visually depict the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp#:~:text=The%20efficient%20frontier%20is%20the,for%20the%20level%20of%20risk.">efficient frontier</a>, of which I developed a fast algorithm to determine. This project was completed with two other peers, and was written in C++.</p>

<h2>Space Protector</h2>
<h4>Summer 2020</h4>
<p>An asteroids-like video game that I coded from scratch the summer after I took <a href ="https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP20/class/CS/1110">Intro to Computing</a>. Features include mouse control, polar/cartesian mathematics, increasing difficulty, and spritework. This was coded in Python using pygame.</p>

<h2>The Cavern</h2>
<h4>Spring 2016</h4>
<p>A mod I created for Call of Duty: World at War's zombies mode. Created during my freshman year of high school, I consider it to be my first 3D modelling + game design project. It has received over 5000 downloads and multiple YouTube playthroughs.</p>
